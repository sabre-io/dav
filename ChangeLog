1.1.0-alpha (????-??-??)
	* Removed: Sabre_PHP_Exception. PHP has a built-in ErrorException for
	  this.
	* Added: PDO authentication backend
	* Fixed: Better error display in browser plugin.
	* Added: Support for {DAV:}supported-report-set 
	* Changed: {DAV:}resourceType defaults to 0
	* Changed: Any non-null resourceType now gets a / appended to the href
	  value. Before this was just for {DAV:}collection's, but this is now also
	  the case for for example {DAV:}principal.
	* Changed: The Href property class can now optionally create non-relative
	  uri's.

1.0.5-stable (2010-01-22)
	* Fixed: Fatal error when a malformed url was used for unlocking, in
	  conjuction with Sabre.autoload.php due to a incorrect filename.
	* Fixed: Improved unittests and build system 

1.0.4-stable (2010-01-11)
	* Fixed: needed 2 different releases. One for googlecode and one for
	  pearfarm. This is to retain the old method to install SabreDAV until
	  pearfarm becomes the standard installation method.

1.0.3-stable (2010-01-11)
	* Added: RFC4709 support (davmount)
	* Added: 6 unittests
	* Added: naturalselection. A tool to keep cache directories below a
	  specified theshold.
	* Changed: Now using pearfarm.org channel server.

1.0.1-stable (2009-12-22)
	* Fixed: Issue 15: typos in examples
	* Fixed: Minor pear installation issues

1.0.0-stable (2009-11-02)
	* Added: SimpleDirectory class. This class allows creating static
	  directory structures with ease.
	* Changed: Custom complex properties and exceptions now get an instance of
	  Sabre_DAV_Server as their first argument in serialize()
	* Changed: Href complex property now prepends server's baseUri
	* Changed: delete before an overwriting copy/move is now handles by server
	  class instead of tree classes
	* Changed: events must now explicitly return false to stop execution.
	  Before, execution would be stopped by anything loosely evaluating to
	  false.
	* Changed: the getPropertiesForPath method now takes a different set of
	  arguments, and returns a different response. This allows plugin
	  developers to return statuses for properties other than 200 and 404. The
	  hrefs are now also always calculated relative to the baseUri, and not
	  the uri of the request.
	* Changed: generatePropFindResponse is renamed to generateMultiStatus, and
	  now takes a list of properties similar to the response of
	  getPropertiesForPath. This was also needed to improve flexibility for
	  plugin development.
	* Changed: Auth plugins are no longer included. They were not yet stable
	  quality, so they will probably be reintroduced in a later version.
	* Changed: PROPPATCH also used generateMultiStatus now.
	* Removed: unknownProperties event. This is replaced by the
	  afterGetProperties event, which should provide more flexibility. 
	* Fixed: Only calling getSize() on IFile instances in httpHead()
	* Added: beforeBind event. This is invoked upon file or directory creation
	* Added: beforeWriteContent event, this is invoked by PUT and LOCK on an
	  existing resource.
	* Added: beforeUnbind event. This is invoked right before deletion of any
	  resource.
	* Added: afterGetProperties event. This event can be used to make
	  modifications to property responses.
	* Added: beforeLock and beforeUnlock events.
	* Added: afterBind event.
	* Fixed: Copy and Move could fail in the root directory. This is now
	  fixed.
	* Added: Plugins can now be retrieved by their classname. This is useful
	  for inter-plugin communication.
	* Added: The Auth backend can now return usernames and user-id's.
	* Added: The Auth backend got a getUsers method
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_FSExt_Directory now returns quota info

0.12.1-beta (2009-09-11)
	* Fixed: UNLOCK bug. Unlock didn't work at all

0.12-beta (2009-09-10)
	* Updated: Browser plugin now shows multiple {DAV:}resourcetype values
	  if available.
	* Added: Experimental PDO backend for Locks Manager
	* Fixed: Sending Content-Length: 0 for every empty response. This
	  improves NGinx compatibility.
	* Fixed: Last modification time is reported in UTC timezone. This improves
	  Finder compatibility.

0.11-beta (2009-08-11)
	* Updated: Now in Beta
	* Updated: Pear package no longer includes docs/ directory. These just
	  contained rfc's, which are publically available. This reduces the
	  package from ~800k to ~60k
	* Added: generatePropfindResponse now takes a baseUri argument
	* Added: ResourceType property can now contain multiple resourcetypes.
	* Fixed: Issue 13. 

0.10-alpha (2009-08-03)
	* Added: Plugin to automatically map GET requests to non-files to
	  PROPFIND (Sabre_DAV_Browser_MapGetToPropFind). This should allow 
	  easier debugging of complicated WebDAV setups.
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_Property_Href class. For future use.
	* Added: Ability to choose to use auth-int, auth or both for HTTP Digest
	  authentication. (Issue 11)
	* Changed: Made more methods in Sabre_DAV_Server public.
	* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter plugin now intercepts HTTP LOCK requests
	  to non-existant files. (Issue 12)
	* Added: Central list of defined xml namespace prefixes. This can reduce
	  Bandwidth and legibility for xml bodies with user-defined namespaces.
	* Added: now a PEAR-compatible package again, thanks to Michael Gauthier
	* Changed: moved default copy and move logic from ObjectTree to Tree class

0.9-alpha (2009-07-21)
	* Changed: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree
	  objects. The Server class now directly works with the INode, IFile
	  and IDirectory objects. If you created your own Tree objects,
	  this will most likely break in this release.
	* Changed: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes
	  into a separate plugin.
	* Changed: TemporaryFileFilter is now a plugin.
	* Added: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of
	  the includer script, and is preferered by some people.
	* Added: AWS Authentication class.
	* Added: simpleserversetup.py script. This will quickly get a fileserver
	  up and running.
	* Added: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a
	  priority. This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication
	  Plugin is used before any other Plugin.
	* Added: 22 new tests.
	* Added: Users-manager plugin for .htdigest files. Experimental and
	  subject to change.
	* Added: RFC 2324 HTTP 418 status code
	* Fixed: Exclusive locks could in some cases be picked up as shared locks
	* Fixed: Digest auth for non-apache servers had a bug (still not actually
	  tested this well).

0.8-alpha (2009-05-30)
	* Changed: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every
	  Exception now follows Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound convention
	  instead of Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException.
	* Added: Browser plugin now allows uploading and creating directories
	  straight from the browser.
	* Added: 12 more unittests
	* Fixed: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.
	* Fixed: Netdrive support
	* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter filtered out too many files. Fixed some
	  of the regexes.
	* Fixed: Added README and ChangeLog to package

0.7-alpha (2009-03-29)
	* Added: System to return complex properties from PROPFIND.
	* Added: support for {DAV:}supportedlock.
	* Added: support for {DAV:}lockdiscovery.
	* Added: 6 new tests.
	* Added: New plugin system.
	* Added: Simple HTML directory plugin, for browser access.
	* Added: Server class now sends back standard pre-condition error xml
	bodies. This was new since RFC4918.
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_Tree_Aggregrate, which can 'host' multiple Tree objects
	into one.
	* Added: simple basis for HTTP REPORT method. This method is not used yet,
	but can be used by plugins to add reports.
	* Changed: ->getSize is only called for files, no longer for collections.
	r303
	* Changed: Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter
	* Changed: Sabre_DAV_TemporaryFileFilter is now called
	Sabre_DAV_Tree_TemporaryFileFilter.
	* Changed: removed functions (get(/set)HTTPRequest(/Response)) from Server
	class, and using a public property instead.
	* Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't
	show up in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)
	* Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.
	* Fixed: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per RFC4918
	sec 8.2.
	* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter now lets through GET's if they actually
	exist on the backend. (r274)
	* FIxed: Some methods didn't get passed through in the FilterTree (r283).
	* Fixed: LockManager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly
	less. (r287)

0.6-alpha (2009-02-16)
	* Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings.
	  This means it won't require to hold entire files in memory, which can be
	  an issue if you're dealing with big files. Note that this breaks 
	  compatibility for put() and createFile methods.
	* Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Support for HTTP Range header
	* Added: Support for ETags within If: headers
	* Added: The API can now return ETags and override the default Content-Type
	* Added: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using PHPUnit.
	* Added: 49 unittests.
	* Added: Abstraction for the HTTP request.
	* Updated: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags
	are serialized as {namespace}tagName instead of namespace#tagName
	* Fixed: HTTP_BasicAuth class now works as expected.
	* Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.
	* Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.
	* Fixed: PROPFIND now sends back information about the requestUri even
	  when "Depth: 1" is specified.

0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)
	* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP
	  file streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a
	  WebDAV to FTP proxy.
	* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.
	* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Reponse class. This centralizes HTTP operations and
	  will be a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
	* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements
	  are removed
	  from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of 
	  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made
	  to allow easier integration into applications not using this standard
	  inclusion model.
	* Updated: Better in-file documentation.
	* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.
	* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.
	* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.
	* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to
	  Sabre_HTTP_Response.
	* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.

0.4-alpha (2008-11-05)
	* Passes all litmus tests!
	* Added: more examples
	* Added: Custom property support
	* Added: Shared lock support
	* Added: Depth support to locks
	* Added: Locking on unmapped urls (non-existant nodes)
	* Fixed: Advertising as WebDAV class 3 support

0.3-alpha (2008-06-29) 
	* Fully working in MS Windows clients.
	* Added: temporary file filter: support for smultron files.
	* Added: Phing build scripts 
	* Added: PEAR package 
	* Fixed: MOVE bug identied using finder.
	* Fixed: Using gzuncompress instead of gzdecode in the temporary file
	  filter. This seems more common.

0.2-alpha (2008-05-27) 
	* Somewhat working in Windows clients 
	* Added: Working PROPPATCH method (doesn't support custom properties yet)
	* Added: Temporary filename handling system 
	* Added: Sabre_DAV_IQuota to return quota information
	* Added: PROPFIND now reads the request body and only supplies the
	  requested properties

0.1-alpha (2008-04-04)
	* First release!
	* Passes litmus: basic, http and copymove test.
	* Fully working in Finder and DavFSv2

Project started: 2007-12-13
